# VitaminD_Autoimmune_Conditions

These scripts pertain to MR analyses investigating the relationship between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases of interest.

The script "Test_Dataset_November" has been used as a starting point and replaces scripts '0.1' and '0.2' until 
these can be adapted to the final datasets selected for the analysis (with correct column names etc).

Test Analysis: Exposure = vitamin D and Outcome = MIP1B (cytokine)
Sample exposure dataset: "VITD_SAMPLE_6SNPs"
Sample outcome dataset: "MIP1Bdf_SAMPLE_6SNPs"
