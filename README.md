# VitaminD_Autoimmune_Conditions

These scripts pertain to MR analyses investigating the relationship between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases of interest.

The script "Test_Dataset_November" has been used as a starting point and replaces scripts '0.1' and '0.2' until 
these can be adapted to the final datasets selected for the analysis (with correct column names etc).
